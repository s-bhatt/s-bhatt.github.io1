	<ul class="about">
  <p>Having worked at Indiaâ€™s leading e-Commerce company <li><a href="https://flipkart.com">Flipkart</a></li> as a Software Development Engineer for 2+ years, I have had the experience of various challenging projects as a part of the Flipkart Location Intelligence and Mapping Team. Here I gained the experience of working on a diverse tech-stack which included Java, Python, Dropwizard, Spark, Kafka, Cassandra, and Solr. Serving close to 10 million requests per day and crunching shards of data are indicative of the scale and complexity of these projects.</p> 

<p>I am extremely excited and actively looking for Summer 2018 Internship opportunities in Software Engineering, where I will get a chance to collaborate with insanely talented people and be a part of high impacting synergistic teams.</p>
