E-Commerce Object Recognizer.

A web service which helps people find the name of the products by just taking a photo with their cell phone.

The tools used:
	-YOLO - Real Time Object Detection
	-TensorFlow For Poets
	-Flask and Python Libs
	-Web Driver

Methodology:
	-The object with highest accuracy is detected, extracted and cropped from the image.
	-This cropped image is now given as an input to the classifier that we trained.
	-The classifier then predicts the brand of the image.
	-We used a pre-trained model from image-net and we retrained the classification layer of our model to predict and classify a few brands.
	-We used the Python Flask framework as our web server and HTML for the web app.

Future work:
	-Improve training using a bigger dataset and.
	-Try real time object detection and predictiction through camera.
	-Accurate predictions would further enable automated web crawling and integration of price comparison systems.
